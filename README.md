## Clock-a-doodle-doo
A single web page displaying the current time. The web page changes when the clock strikes a particular time.
The times that trigger the change are as follows:
01:23, 08:50, 11:11, 12:34, 13:57, 16:20, 20:20, 21:21, 22:22, 23:23, 23:45

I have used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create this project.
