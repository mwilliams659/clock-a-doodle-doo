## Clock-a-doodle-doo
A single web page displaying the current time. The web page changes when the clock strikes a particular time.
The times that trigger the change are as follows:

00:00, 01:01, 01:10, 01:11, 01:23, 02:02, 02:20, 02:22, 03:00, 03:03, 03:33, 04:04, 04:20, 05:05, 05:55, 06:00, 06:06, 07:07, 08:08, 08:50, 09:00, 09:09, 10:10, 11:11, 12:00, 12:12, 12:21, 12:34, 13:13, 13:57, 14:14, 15:00, 15:15, 16:16, 16:20, 17:17, 18:00, 18:18, 19:19, 20:20, 21:00, 21:21, 22:22, 23:23, 23:45.
